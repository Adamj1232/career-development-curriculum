Job search action plan for M4, using this template:

# Template: Module 4 Action Plan 
## Module 4 Goals
*List your longterm goal(s) of what you want to accomplish by the end of module 4*
 I want to have a job offer by the end of Mod 4 and be working within a month of graduating or sooner. 
 I want to have a proffesional and quality portfolio that allows me to get the best job possible.

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day
* I will start, hopefully finish a personal portfolio site over break.
* I will Re-evaluate my resume over and over til I am happy as well as get feedback from as many people as possible on it.
* I will follow up multiple times with potential industry contacts
* Every day I will do one of the following:
  - Code
  - Email a contact person
  - Put more time into each portfolio project to get them all working better and better

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
*How will you focus your learning to accomplish your longterm goal?*
* Gain knowledge in Angular and TypeScript
* I will build a portfolio I can show off to potential employers which I will begin over break and constantly tweak.
 
  
#### Opportunities Research:
*How will you continue researching companies and contacts? How will you utilize your Trello Board?* 
* I will post on social media that I am close to graduation.
* Share my portoflio and projects over social media
* I will research consultancies in my target cities
* I will look for apprenticeships at larger companies

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
*Who will you reach out to? Have you considered talking with alumni about their own networking practices when they started their job search?
* I will reach out to friends that I have that already work in the industry.
* I will communicate with my mentor and ask lots of questions about interviews and employment.
* I will reach out to appropriate people at the companies I identify as good matches

#### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
*How might personal branding pieces help you towards your goal?*
* It will make me look like I have drive and personal empowerment the more I brand myself and show that I am a self starter.
* I'm going to apply for jobs that I probably am underqualified for. To help my chances:
  - Practice interview questions and whiteboarding
  - Put time in on past projects to make my portfolio pop!
  - Build out personal site to look proffesional

### Timeline:
*What will you do when?*
* By intermission week:
  - Begin my personal portfolio site
  - Checkin with mentor
  - Ask mentor to give feedback on my projects
* During intermission week:
  - Tighten up resume
  - Send Resume to Charter Comm
  - Solidify portfolio projects 
* After intermission week:
  - Send resume to more companies after personal portfolio is complete
  
#### Module Tasks:
*What will you do throughout the module?*
* Work on learning Angular and Typescript
* Look for potential companies
* Keep working on my past projects
* Whatever's on the calendar

#### Weekly Tasks:
*What will you do throughout each week?*
* I will try to shadow a few companies throughout the mod
* Every day I will do one of the following:
  - Spend time looking for jobs
  - Email a contact person
  - Work on coding challenges

Name of contact

"The mentor (and alum) I contacted is Adam Jensen___"

Date of contact 03/31/2017 He responded and we have been chatting over slack since as he mentors me. He has given me a lot of insight about the community and how his journey has gone since leaving school as well as mentoring me on different code challenges I have come up against.

Link to reflection on agile practices/project management used in projects (What project management strategies did you use in your projects this module? What went well? What would you do differently next time?):
This module I tried to use as many agile practices that were suitable, I often ask for feedback and usability then try to implement those change and then ask again for more feedback. I also often like to set a sprint in less time then the project because it almost always takes longer. I also aim for half rather then half-assed if it comes down to that choice and always add features last and functionality first

Link to reflection on in-person feedback conversation using these guidelines
Date of feedback conversation: 3/22/2017

How did you prepare for the conversation? reflected on the past project and considered where both parties were coming from in each instance

How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? The conversation went well for me, it was easy to talk about a project that has been run recently but it turns out it didn't really accomplish anything as the anonymous adjective' feedback I received from the partner I originally spoke with was very different then this feedback conversation

What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation? I used the appreciation principle of feedback in my conversation, trying to show how grateful I was to take on that project with that person and learn those challenging things together. I thought it went well but as I said I don't think the adjective feedback with fitting

Any other comments:

Link to feedback implementation reflection & application of strengths to teams using these guidelines
What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator? I really enjoy receiving different ideas and explanations from students rather then instructors if something is confusing because if I am confused from the way something is explained then the student who does understand it can probably see where I am coming from.

How do you use your strengths as a team member? I like to work together, side by side through the most difficult programing and save the time consuming css to work on after hours making both members strong when it comes to difficult concepts. I also like to explain concepts that I understand and am patient when doing so and I think that helps make me a stronger team player.

How would you like to continue to develop your strengths? I would like to continue to develop a greater grasp over concepts and practices as well as become more fluent with vocabulary so communication is clearer.

What would you like to improve on as a teammate? Become better at speaking my mind when I have an idea and develop a grasp of what should be done to make something work properly

How would you like your teammates to see you? A helpful and supportive team member that has a solid understanding but can still learn a lot from other members ideas
